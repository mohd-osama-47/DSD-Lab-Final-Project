# DSD-Lab-Final-Project
This is the used code to create a scrolling seven segment unit that shows my student ID : 20161372.

Scrolling_VHDL_Code contains the code for the scrolling 7 segment display. 201610372- is scrolled indefinitely across the sceven segment display.

Seg_Display contains the code of just displaying four numbers in the 7 segment display. The numbers 0372 are only displayed without any scrolling going on.
